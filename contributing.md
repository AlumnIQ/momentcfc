1. A test case showing your bug in action will probably get it fixed a lot faster.
  - Even better: If you can provide your **input**, your **expected output**, your **actual output**, and your system time zone, that will go a long way in helping diagnose bugs.
1. Pull requests welcome. Please be sure to [use a feature branch in your fork](http://adamtuttle.codes/your-first-github-pull-request/).
1. Trolls and jerks will not be tolerated.
