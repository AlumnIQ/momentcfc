# Moment.cfc

Inspired by moment.js, but not a strict port. With added Time Zone switchy goodness!

### Compatibility

To date, development has been done against Adobe ColdFusion 11, in particular giving preference to `dateTimeFormat()` and its masks. Adobe CF10 compatibility might be possible, but probably not as easy as Lucee and Railo. Pull requests welcome in this department!

## Testing

It is assumed that you have [TestBox](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/TestBox.cfm) installed. (A mapping to `/testbox` should be sufficient.) Then just navigate to `tests.cfc?method=runRemote` in your browser.
