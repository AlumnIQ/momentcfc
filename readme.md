# Moment.cfc

Inspired by moment.js, but not a strict port. With added Time Zone switchy goodness!

### Compatibility

To date, development has been done against Adobe ColdFusion 11. With some luck, or a little bit of work, it should work just fine on CF10, Lucee, and Railo too.

## Testing

You are expected to have TestBox installed. (A mapping to `/testbox` should be sufficient.) Then just navigate to `tests.cfc?method=runRemote` in your browser.
