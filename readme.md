# Moment.cfc

Inspired by moment.js, but not a strict port. With added Time Zone switchy goodness!

CFML is all about making complex things simple, but date-math seems to have missed this boat.

## Basic Date & Time Methods

#### Init

The constructor takes 0, 1, or 2 arguments.

- `new moment()` Use the current system time and the current system time zone
- `new moment( now() )` Use the specified time (argument) and the current system time zone
- `new moment( now(), 'America/Pacific' )` Use the specified time (argument) and the specified time zone (argument)

The datetime argument accepts a native CFML datetime object (e.g. `now()` or `createDateTime()`) or just a string (e.g. `2008-11-27 13:47`).

The time zone strings that moment expects are the internationalized strings, such as "America/New_York". You can find a full list [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List), or have moment generate it for you -- but more on that later.

#### Add/Subtract some time

The syntax and format masks for `dateAdd()` aren't that hard to remember, but they also aren't very readable. We can do better...

	new moment().add(1, 'day').subtract(6, 'weeks');

Here's a list of all masks you can use with add/subtract:

- Years: `years`, `year`, `y`
- Quarters: `quarters`, `quarter`, `q`
- Weeks: `weeks`, `week`, `w` *
- Days: `days`, `day`, `d`
- Weekdays: `weekdays`, `weekday`, `wd` *
- Hours: `hours`, `hour`, `h`
- Minutes: `minutes`, `minute`, `n`
- Seconds: `seconds`, `second`, `s`
- Milliseconds: `milliseconds`, `millisecond`, `ms` * *

**\* Deviation from the official dateAdd mask:** Adobe, in their infinite wisdom, decided to use `ww` for weeks and `w` for weekdays. Moment uses the sane alternative defined here.

**\* \* Another deviation from the official dateAdd mask:** `ms` just makes more sense than the `l` (lower case L) that Adobe uses.

#### Clone

Returns a new moment instance with the same datetime and time zone.

	now_ = new moment();
	alsoNow = now_.clone();

#### Min/Max

To find the lower/upper date, use min/max:

	minTime = new moment().min( myMomentA, myMomentB );
	maxTime = new moment().max( myMomentA, myMomentB );

#### Difference

Find the difference between two datetimes in datepart units, considering time zone differences (their UTC times are compared):

	x = new moment();
	y = new moment( '2008-11-27 13:47' );
	diff = y.diff( x, 'hours' );

Returns the number of units that `y` is less than `x`.

The same masking values from `add`/`subtract` work with `diff`.

**NOTE:** Adobe ColdFusion does not support millisecond-level diffing, but it's not hard to add (lazy!)... So I did.

#### Format

Apply a [DateTimeFormat](https://wikidocs.adobe.com/wiki/display/coldfusionen/DateTimeFormat) mask to the current timestamp and return the resulting string.

	x = new moment();
	x.format( 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:nn:ss' );
	//=> "2008-11-27 13:47"

#### From

Fuzzy time difference description between the two moments, **always** phrased in past tense:

	x = new moment( '2008-11-27' );
	y = new moment();

	x.from( y );
	//=> 6 years ago

	y.from( x );
	//=> 6 years ago

#### FromNow

Shorthand for calling `from` when one of the comparators ~= `now()`.

	x = new moment( '2008-11-27' );
	x.fromNow();
	//=> 6 years ago

#### Epoch

Get your moment in its unix epoch format: milliseconds since 1970-01-01.

	x = new moment( '2008-11-27' );
	x.epoch();
	//=> 1227762000000

#### isBefore / isAfter

Compare two dates to determine which one is before/after the other. Default datepart precision is `seconds`.

	x = new moment( '2008-11-27' );
	y = new moment();
	old = x.isBefore( y, 'hours' );
	//=> true

	stillOld = y.isAfter( x, 'days' );
	//=> true

Here's a list of all precisions you can use with isBefore / isAfter:

- Years: `years`, `year`, `y`
- Months: `months`, `month`, `m`
- Days: `days`, `day`, `d`
- Hours: `hours`, `hour`, `h`
- Minutes: `minutes`, `minute`, `n`
- Seconds: `seconds`, `second`, `s`

#### isSame

Just like isBefore / isAfter, except you're testing that the two moments are the same, at least to the specified level of precision. Uses the same precisions as isBefore / isAfter.

	x = new moment( '2008-11-27 13:47' );
	y = new moment( '2008-11-27 6:30' );
	same = x.isSame( y, 'hours' );
	//=> true

#### isBetween

Determines if the current moment is between the two argument moments, at least to the specified level of precision.

	x = new moment( '2008-11-27 06:30' );
	y = new moment( '2008-11-27 13:47' );
	z = new moment( '2011-01-01 06:06' );
	betwixt = y.isBetween( y, 'minutes' );
	//=> true

#### getDateTime

After all is said and done, sometimes you just need the raw datetime object back. This'll give it to you.

	raw = new moment( '2008-11-27 13:47' ).getDateTime();
	//=> {ts '2008-11-27 13:47:00'}

## Time Zones

In addition to all of the great date math you can do (with moment's better syntax), moment also has baked-in support for Time Zone functionality, using the robust underlying `java.util.TimeZone` class.

Create a timestamp in the US-Eastern time zone:

	x = new moment( '2008-11-27 13:47:00', 'America/New_York' );

When you don't pass a time zone argument, the current system time zone is used. When you don't pass a time argument, the current system time is used. `new moment()` and `new moment( '2008-11-27 13:47:00' )` and `new moment( '2008-11-27 13:47:00', 'America/New_York' )` are all equally valid.

#### UTC

Convert a moment's current time to its UTC value (also updates the internal time zone value to "UTC"):

	x.utc();

#### TZ

Instead of UTC, let's see what time that would have been in Phoenix using the `.tz()` method to change our moment to another time zone:

	new moment( '2008-11-27 13:47', 'America/New_York' ).tz( 'America/Phoenix' ).format( 'hh:nn' );
	//=> 03:06

And yes, all of the above methods (constructor as well as `.utc()` and `.tz()`) are chainable.

#### isDST

Curious if your current moment is during Daylight Saving Time?

	dst = new moment( '2008-11-27', 'America/New_York' ).isDST();
	//=> false

#### getZoneOffset

Return a time zone's current offset in seconds. This _does_ respect Daylight Saving Time:

	offset = new moment().getZoneOffset( 'Australia/Perth' );
	//=> 28800

#### getCurrentOffset

Get the current offset of a moment in seconds, without knowing its time zone:

	offset = myMoment.getCurrentOffset();

#### getZone

Get the current time zone from the moment:

	myMoment.getZone();
	//=> "America/New_York"

#### getSystemTZ

Get your system time zone:

	myMoment.getSystemTZ();
	//=> "America/New_York"

#### getZoneTable

Get a list of all world time zones and their displayable offsets. This lists the zone's current offset, respecting their Daylight Saving Time rules:

	tbl = new moment().getZoneTable();
	//=> { "America/New_York": "-4:00", ... }

## Compatibility

To date, development has been done against Adobe ColdFusion 10 and 11, in particular giving preference to `dateTimeFormat()` and its masks. Adobe CF9 compatibility might be possible, but probably not as easy as Lucee and Railo. Pull requests welcome in this department!

## Testing

It is assumed that you have [TestBox](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/TestBox.cfm) installed. (A mapping to `/testbox` should be sufficient.) Then just navigate to `tests.cfc?method=runRemote` in your browser.
